# Clustering-European-Union-Horizon-2020-Projects

This project is about analysing and finding similar EU horizon 2020 projects and do clustering on them.
We had over 5200 projects in XML data format to analyse with our code. Every project has its unique
RCN code that we can use it for naming files. We will find similarities with criterias such that:

1. Teaser
2. Titles
3. Total Cost
4. Funding scheme
5. Duration
6. The year that project happens
7. Coordinator
8. Coordinator country

Our goal was clustering the similar contexted projects with each other to create a similarity(cluster) tree.
